# Health-monitoring-system
This project is a health monitoring system using an Arduino Uno to measure heart rate, blood oxygen (SpO2), and temperature, displaying results on an OLED. It also includes a medicine reminder feature set via a mobile app, triggering a buzzer and displaying "Medicine Reminder" on the screen when it's time.
